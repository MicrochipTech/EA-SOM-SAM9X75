# SAM9X75 System-On-Modules Series
## Early Access Repository

The SAM9X75 System-On-Module (SOM) series is a single-sided solderable SOM based on the SAM9X75 ARM926EJ-S CPU running up to 800MHz.  The SAM9X75 SOM series is based on a SAM9X75 System-in-Package (SIP) with up to 2Gb DDR3L SDRAM and up to 4-Gbit NAND Flash memory, a Gigabit Ethernet PHY, a 64-Mbit serial Quad I/O Flash memory and a dedicated Power Management IC.   This new SOM series is targeted for production very soon, but in the meantime this Github repository serves as the main resource for documentation and software support for the SAM9X75 SOM series.  Samples are available today, please contact your local Microchip sales office. 

For more information about the SAM9X75 CPU, or the associated SIPs referenced above, please visit the respective product page on Microchip.com.
